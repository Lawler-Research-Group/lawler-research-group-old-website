## Our vision

is to exploit our understanding of fine tuning such as in frustrated magnets and quantum computing to discover new phenomena in strongly correlated electron systems.

Focus Areas

We focus on:
- Deepening our understanding of frustrated magnets
- the role of topological invariants in demanding accidental degeneracy
- electrons with soft (degenerate) Fermi surfaces;
- controlling material properties for practical applications when they have difficulty deciding between ground states.

Each of these topics except the first takes the history of the field of frustrated magnetism and applies it to hard problems encountered in other fields. For example, cuprate superconductors display intertwined orders, multiple phases which compete for attention despite attempts to favor one phase over another. They are frustrated in this way. Perhaps our understanding of superconductivity could be greatly improved if we could understand where this frustration was comming from!
